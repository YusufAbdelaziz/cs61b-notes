# 33 - Software Engineering III

### Case Study: Social Media vs. Khan Academy.

- Case Study 1: Candy Crush.
    - Candy Crush tracks the number of days you have played in a row.
    - Every consecutive day gets you a reward.
    - Whenever you miss a day, the indicator resets.
    - This feature exists to:
        - Keep you playing.
        - Pop up some ads to earn revenue.

- Case Study 2: Snapchat.
    - Similarly, for every day that you and a friend communicate on snapchat, your snap streak is extended by one day.
    - This feature exists to:
        - Keep you engaged with the app.

- Case Study 3: TikTok.
    - The moment you open the app, a video is playing.
    - You can easily swipe to the next video.
    - This feature exists to (like the previous 2 case studies):
        - Increase engagement.

- Positive and negative impacts that engagement features have on the world.
    
    
    | Positive | Negative |
    | --- | --- |
    | - Makes company money, so the company its good.
    - Build communities, snapstreaks                                           - increase engagement between people (Well? Not sure?)
    - Learn a lot on DuoLingo and Ed.
    - Streaks give you an excuse to talk to your ex.   | - Streaks give you an excuse to talk to your ex.
    - Addictive behavior is not so good
    - Distraction from what you are supposed to be doing like working.
    - Wasting electricity.
    - Algorithms that show you only information with which you already agree.
    - The more you use a platform, the more of your data goes in. |
- Is TikTok a net positive for the world?
    - Net negative: Shortens attention span.
    - Depends: TikTok, a bunch of stupid trends in the U.S. But in other countries, they are more creative / educational.
    - Net negative: You get shot straight into echo chamber where you believe mummies are running the government.
    - TikTok is short term gratification, like eating a giant pile of sugar.
    - Positive: You can keep up with the world, all kinds of news at once.
    - Positive: Very easy content creators to reach an audience.
    - Negative: Huge amounts of misinformation.
    - Regardless of content, nuance is lost in very short videos that only reach people if they receive high engagement.
- Case Study 4: Khan Academy.
    - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a website for teaching students with various grades.
    - It has many positive impacts on the world such as:
        - Easy access to education.
        - Asynchronous education, you can learn anytime.
        - Greater for low income communities.
        - Trustworthy resource.
        - Has a reward system that keeps you coming back.
    - But unfortunately, it has some negatives:
        - Teachers use Khan Academy videos instead of teaching themselves.
        - Hard to ask questions, not as high quality as an interactive form of instruction.
        - Unclear how it accommodates disabilities.
        - Limit to how many languages.
- Khan Academy is obviously more useful than TikTok. Why would you think people still want to work for TikTok (ByteDance) over Khan Academy?
    - Money is a huge one.
    - Money.
    - Benefits (e.g. money).
    - Power: Everyone uses it. Your work reaches a lot of people.
        - One note is that youâ€™re just one little person out of 150,000. Usually, the bigger the company is, the smaller your contribution as a normal SWE becomes.
    - TikTok is growing very quickly.
    - TikTok hires lots more people with lots of different skills. More opportunities.
    - TikTok is international! Opportunities all over.
    - Lack of dignity, therefore you have no qualms working for the MACHINE.
    - Money.
