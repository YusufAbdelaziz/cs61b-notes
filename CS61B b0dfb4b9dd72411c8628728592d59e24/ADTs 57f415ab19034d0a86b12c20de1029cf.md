# ADTs.

- An ADT (Abstract Data Type) is defined only by its operations, not by its implementation.
- So a stack might be a good example of an ADT, in which its operations is to push and pop items.

        - Actually both are about the same.
        - Resizing in the array implementation wouldnâ€™t hurt the overall performance, but linked lists are still a little faster.

    - Answer.
        - Array is a better option, because you might swap the last item in the array with the item you want to remove and decrement the size of the array which would result in a constant time operation.
- Interfaces in Java can serve as an abstraction of an implementation so *List* interface is implemented by ArrayList and LinkedList classes.
- Notice that interfaces are not precisely an abstraction as they may contain default methods unlike abstract classes.
- Most important interface that other interfaces extend from is the Collections interface. This interface abstracts the ability of putting a collection of objects inside a single entity.
- Interfaces like List, Set, and Map extends from this interface.
