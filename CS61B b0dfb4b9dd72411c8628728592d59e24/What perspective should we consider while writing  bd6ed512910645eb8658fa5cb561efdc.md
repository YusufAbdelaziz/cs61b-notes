# What perspective should we consider while writing efficient code ?

1. Programming Cost 
    1. How long does it take for you to develop your programs?
    2. How easy is it to read or modify your code?
    3. How maintainable is your code? (very important — much of the cost comes from maintenance and scalability, not development!)
2. Execution Cost 
    1. **Time complexity**: How much time does it take for your program to execute?
    2. **Space complexity**: How much memory does your program require?
