# B-Trees.

- Intro - Binary Tree Height And Depth.
    - Why should we be concerned with tree height ? To build an intuition on the importance of tree height let’s first answer a question.
    - Quiz Time !
        - We have two tress, bushy and spindly tress and both are of same height
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled.png)
            
            The main question is, we want to find a function of the growth of the tree height whenever we add an element to each tree
            
            - Answer
                - The answer is B which is $\Theta{(\log{N})}$ and $\Theta(N)$.
                - You can notice that the spindly tree is identical to a normal linked list.
                - The bushy tree needs 16 items to fulfil the fourth floor of the tree.

    - Let’s review asymptotics on tree height through the following quiz.
    - Tree height quiz.

    - We can see from the previous quiz that BST height can be one of the valid running time functions :
        - $O(N)$
        - $\Theta(\log{N})$ in best case (bushy tree).
        - $\Theta(N)$ in worst case (spindly tree).
        - $O(N^2)$
    - But you can also notice that the two statements at the middle are the most informative ones.
    - As we said in asymptotics section, Big O is NOT mathematically the same as “worst case”.
    - So we can say the tree height is quadratic but its worst case in fact is linear. However, in interviews or real word, worst case and Big O are used interchangeably. So we can see a **tree’s height** is $O(N)$ for short.
    - Important terminology
        
        ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%206.png)
        
        - For average depth, we multiply the number of nodes to each depth level.
        - It’s calculated by the formula
            
            $$
            \frac{\sum_{i=0}^D{d_in_i}}{N}
            $$
            
        - Where $d_i$ is depth and n is the number of nodes at that depth.
    - We just introduced height and average depth concepts, why there’re useful ?
    - The **Height** of a tree ****determines the **worst case runtime to find a node**.
    - The **Average depth** determines the **average case runtime to find a node**

    - A nice property of random trees (their nodes are inserted randomly) is that they have $\Theta(\log{N})$ average depth and height.
    - What we can expect from that property is that the worst case runtime for **contains** operation is $\Theta(\log{N})$ on a tree built with random inserts.
    - It’s important to mention that we can’t always insert our items in random order. A reason for that is **data comes in over time, don’t have all at once.**
    - Which means that you might have data that ruin your tree structure and make it spindly.

- B-Trees
    - Intro to B-trees (What problems it solves, Basic Insertion, Common Types).
        - We had an issue in the BST as its height gets more bigger when the data we insert is not random and they’re coming in order.
        - Let’s think about this tree →
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2011.png)
            
        - We want to add 17, 18, 19 keys to the tree, what should we do ?
        - Let’s try not to add at the leaves of the tree and append these keys to the 16.
        - This is called an **overstuffed** tree which always has balanced height because leaf depths never change (recall that height is the maximum depth in the tree). Note **that the overstuffed node items are sorted**.
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2012.png)
            
        - Overstuffed trees are a logically consistent but very weird data structure. Let’s check if 18 exists in the tree :
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2013.png)
            
        - A problem arises from this approach is that appending might get really big and we’re turning the leaf into an overstuffed leaf aka linked list.
        - We can set a limit L on the number of items in each node, so lets set L = 3.
        - If any node has more than L items, give an item to the parent. You can pick any item arbitrarily so we’d pick the left-middle one. The tree below doesn’t make real sense, 16 is not bigger than 17, what should we do to fix that ?
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2014.png)
            
            - Answer
                - Insert 16 at the middle, so you’d have items that are less than both 15 and 17, item at the middle and items larger than 15 and 17.

        - It’s just important to note that it’s not a binary tree anymore, it’s called a B-Tree.
        - Following the previous procedure, try to add 20 and 21 :
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2016.png)

        - Try to add 25 and 26

        - Following the same approach, we will end up with a root that has too many items
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2020.png)
            
        - What should we do with the root ?
            - Answer
                - 17 will be the root →

        - It’s worth to note that this tree has a perfect balance, all the leaves have the same depth.
        - Two things to observe about B Trees (Splitting-Trees) :
            - If we split the root, all nodes are pushed down by exactly one level (the previous example illustrates this)
            - If we split a leaf node or internal node, the height doesn’t change (the first two examples).
        - Insertion Process
            - The process of adding a node to a 2-3-4 tree is:
                1. We still always inserting into a leaf node, so take the node you want to insert and traverse down the tree with it, going left and right according to whether or not the node to be inserted is greater than or smaller than the items in each node.
                2. After adding the node to the leaf node, if the new node has 4 nodes, then pop up the middle left node and re-arrange the children accordingly.
                3. If this results in the parent node having 4 nodes, then pop up the middle left node again, rearranging the children accordingly.
                4. Repeat this process until the parent node can accommodate or you get to the root.
            - For a 2-3 tree, go through the same process except push up the middle node in a 3-element node.
        - B trees terminology.
            - Splitting Tree might be a better name, but the real name is **B-Trees.**
            - B-trees of order L = 3 (numbers of items in a single node) are also called 2-3-4 tree or a 2-4 tree.
                - “2-3-4” indicates the number of children that a node can have
            - B-trees of order L = 2 are also called a 2-3 tree.

    - ****B-Tree invariants****
        - Try too come up with two trees :

                A B-Tree visualizer can be found [here](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html).
                
        - You can deduce that insertion order matters in BSTs but it doesn’t matter in B-Trees, they’re always bushy. Some insertion order may result in slightly different B-Trees but overall guaranteed to be bushy.
        - What guarantees the bushiness is the two invariants of B-Trees :
            - All leaves must be the same distance from the source (recall the fact that every time you exceed the allowed number of items in a single node, you push all the node to one level and put one node as new parent/root) .
            - A non-leaf node with *k* items must have exactly *k*+1 children.

    - B-Tree Runtime Analysis.
        - Let’s consider two B-Trees, one is a best case height tree and the other is near worst case height tree.
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2028.png)
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2029.png)
            
        - When each node fully consumes the limit L, you can have more items with same height as not fully consuming the limit. That’s the reason why it’s best case tree.
        - The first height growth rate is $\log_3{N}$, whereas the second is $\log_2{N}$.
        - Trimming off the constant subscript, you can say that the overall height is $\Theta(\log{N})$.
        - Runtime for **contains**.
            
            ![Untitled](B-Trees%201fb5b9852c984fbeae52094549388775/Untitled%2030.png)
            
            Note that the number of nodes you look at is the height + 1 as you only choose the correct branch to lookup for your item.
            
        - Runtime for **add**.
