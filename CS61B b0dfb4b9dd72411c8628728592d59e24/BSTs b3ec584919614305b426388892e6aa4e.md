# BSTs.

- Inventing the BST.
    - For an ordered linked list implementation, name an operation (operations) that takes/take worst case linear time i.e. $\Theta(N)$.

        - Answer.
            - Both contains and add methods would take a linear time. **Contains** needs to iterate over the list to make sure an item exists, and **add** would also iterate over the list to reach the last element.
    - You notice that we didn’t take advantage that our list is ordered.
    - You can enhance the performance probabilistically by using a probabilistic data structure known as **SkipList**. In this data structure, you add express lanes such that each element might have a random reference to another element in the array.

    - We can still optimize the searching for an ordered linkedlist. Recall the binary search algorithm that was working with arrays, we can start at the middle of the linkedlist by moving the pointer to the middle, and reverse all references such that we can move from the middle to one of the two halves. This would reduce the amount of time by half.

    - You start to think that we’d do a linear search on the half of the list, can we do the same “middle pointer” idea to the two halves ? Yeah this is possible, we can make D node points to B and F nodes. So at the end, you’d get a tree structure which is called **binary search tree**.

    - So each recursive call reduces the search problem size by half.
- BST Definitions.
    - What is a tree ?
        - A tree is a set of nodes and set of edges that connect these nodes. Notice that a tree is a special type of a graph, so all edges are directed and there’s only one path between any two nodes.
        - No cyclic references are allowed in a tree.

    - What is rooted trees and binary trees ?
        - We can say that one node is the root if every node N except the root has exactly one parent, defined as the first on the path from N to the root.
        - A node with no child is called a leaf.
        - In a rooted tree, a node can have any number of children. Whereas the rooted binary tree, you may have only 0, 1, or 2 children.

    - What is a binary search tree?
        - A BST is a rooted binary tree with **BST property.**
        - The BST property is : For every node X in the tree :
            - Every key in the left subtree is less than X’s key.
            - Every key in the right subtree is greater than X’s key.
    - Important caveats.
        - The ordering must be **complete**, **transitive**, and **antisymmetric**.
        - Given keys p and q (two nodes) in the BST:
            - Exactly one of p < q and q < p are true (no duplicates are allowed).
            - If p < q and q < r, then p < r (**transitive**).
        - No duplicate keys allowed and most real-word implementation follow this rule.
    - BST class we’d use for this lesson.
        
        ```java
        private class BST<Key> {
            private Key key;
            private BST left;
            private BST right;
        
            public BST(Key key, BST left, BST Right) {
                this.key = key;
                this.left = left;
                this.right = right;
            }
        
            public BST(Key key) {
                this.key = key;
            }
        }
        ```
        
    - BST operations.
        - Search
            - Search operation is quite simple. Note that T is the current node we’re accessing.
            - If **searchKey** equals **T.key**, return.
            - If **searchKey < T.key**, go to the left branch **T.left** .
            - If **searchKey > T.key**, go to the right branch **T.right** .
            - Quick quiz about running time.
                - What is the worst case running time of a search operation on N nodes ?
                    
                    ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%206.png)
                    
                    - Answer.
                        - It’s $\Theta(log{N})$. Notice that the height is nearly $log_2{N}$
        - Insertion
            - So insertion is almost identical to search operation, except that if you didn’t find the item you’re looking for, insert it (create a new node, and set appropriate link).
            - The main idea is that you’re traversing to the correct node to which you’d insert the new node.
            - In this case, you have three options :
                - The node you’re adding is bigger than the correct node. Therefore, you’d add the new node to the right.
                - The node you’re adding is smaller than the correct node. Therefore you’d add the new node to the left.
                - The node you’re adding is already there, so you’d just return the current BST.
                
                ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%207.png)
                
            - The previous pseudo code follows the same algorithm we’ve just discussed. Notice that this approach provides less base case and more readable code.
            - The code below is a bad implementation for insertion, as this make the implementation more complicated.

        - Deletion.
            - Deletion has 3 cases →
                - Deletion key has no children.
                    - This is the easiest case, because you just sever the parent reference to that node, and it’d be garbage collected and removed from the memory.
                    - So let’s remove “glut” node from this tree.
                        
                        ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%209.png)
                        
                    - Removal can be easily done by just removing parent’s reference (flat) to the node (glut).
                        
                        ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%2010.png)
                        
                - Deletion key has one child.
                    - An important thing to stick in mind is maintaining the BST property (smaller items on the left, bigger items on the right).
                    - Say you want to remove “flat” node.
                        
                        ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%2011.png)
                        
                    - You already know that all items on the right branch is bigger than the “dog” node. So you can move flat’s parent’s pointer (basically dog) to flat’s child (elf).
                    - Since there’s no pointer referencing the “flat” node, it’d be garbage collected.
                - Deletion key has two children.
                    - You have to pick what is called the **predecessor** or **successor**.
                    - A **predecessor** is the biggest element in the left subtree.
                    - A **successor** is the smallest item in the right subtree.
                    - For the binary tree below, we want to delete a dog, which items can we choose to replace the root node ?
                        
                        ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%2012.png)
                        
                    - We can choose the largest item in the left subtree which is **cat** (predecessor) or the smallest item in the right subtree which is **elf** (successor).
                    - So we can delete the node we select (cat or elf) and then replace it with the node we want to delete (dog).
                    - This would lead us to the first or the second case of deletion in which we might have zero or one child. Why we are guaranteed to be either case 1 or 2? because if we have two children, then we didn’t reach the smallest/largest element (predecessor/successor) in the subtree.
                    - This is known as **Hibbard deletion**.
                    - Quiz time !

                        - Answer
                            - You can safely remove k and replace it with g (predecessor) or m (successor).
                                
                                ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%2014.png)
                                
                    - Notice that there’re other deletion algorithms for BST, but this is the finest one.
    - Sets and Maps
        - We can implement a set using BST (recall that duplicate keys are not allowed in BST so it’s an important property to use in sets).
            
            ![Untitled](BSTs%20b3ec584919614305b426388892e6aa4e/Untitled%2015.png)
            
        - We can adjust the previous structure to implement a map, so we can associate for example word counter for each word. Hence you can modify the node class to add more properties besides the key of the node.
        - Notice that this structure is not ordered with respect to the values associate with the keys, so you can’t fetch the number of times “momo” was inserted efficiently. Actually, you’d need to iterate over all nodes.

        - Both data structures are implemented in Java’s **TreeMap** and **TreeSet**.
